# World-clocK
Clocks have always been with us since the ancient time be it in the form of
Jantar Mantar which is an observatory cum clock (sundial) or Ghatika YantraThe Ancient Indian Water Clock.
The RTC based world clock we designed is capable of showing us
pretty accurate time of 6 time zones(INDIA, NEW YORK, LONDON,
TOKYO, TURKEY, RIO DE JENERIO )simultaneously. Not just the time
but the Day, Date, Month, Year is also displayed using the 20*4 Liquid
Crystal Display which is powered using the Arduino NANO. We can view
the unlisted time zones with a press of a button.
To make things more challenging and fun we decided to add a time set
feature to this clock. We just need to set our current Time zone time and all
other time zone’s time will automatically be adjusted.
We were simply interested in learning more about electronics and
programming, and if we actually give a thought to this building a world clock
using an Arduino Nano could be a fun and challenging project to undertake.
Even in the theory classes our dear Gadre Sir even mentioned us about RTC
sensor and its use case so, we thought building a world clock could be a great
way to apply our knowledge and gain hands-on experience. A world clock
could be a useful tool to have on our desk or in our home, especially if we
frequently interact with people in different time zones. Although a world clock
is available on any smart device now it might be more fun to build one for our
own study desks. And let’s be honest who doesn’t like to have a very own
personalized clock. Another reason we can proudly say that we built this clock
was to push ourselves not to start our day with our so called “smart” phone.
Picking our phone to just have a glance of time in the morning when its
slightly dark to swiping through every possible social media one can have on
his/her device is not so much of a fresh start to the day right? Instead, we can
use this digital clock even at the darkest time of the day or even our life pun
intended.
Overall, building a world clock using an Arduino Nano can be a fun and
rewarding project that allowed us to apply our knowledge and skills in
a practical way.
